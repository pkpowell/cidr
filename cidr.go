// Package cidr is a collection of assorted utilities for computing
// network and host addresses within network ranges.
//
// It expects a CIDR-type address structure where addresses are divided into
// some number of prefix bits representing the network and then the remaining
// suffix bits represent the host.
//
// For example, it can help to calculate addresses for sub-networks of a
// parent network, or to calculate host addresses within a particular prefix.
//
// At present this package is prioritizing simplicity of implementation and
// de-prioritizing speed and memory usage. Thus caution is advised before
// using this package in performance-critical applications or hot codepaths.
// Patches to improve the speed and memory usage may be accepted as long as
// they do not result in a significant increase in code complexity.
